I will analyze the content of `texto.md` and structure it into a professional technical document named `documentacao.md`.

The new document will be organized as follows:

1.  **Project Overview**: Title (SIGF-Const), General Objectives, and Strategic Pillars (Availability, Costs, Safety, Productivity).
2.  **System Architecture**: Detailed description of the 5 modules (Operational Control, Maintenance, Fuel/Tires, Documents, Communication).
3.  **Standard Operating Procedures (POPs)**: Formalized workflows for Asset Incorporation, Daily Operation, Fueling, Maintenance, and Tire Management.
4.  **Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Table of metrics with formulas and targets.
5.  **Catalog of Checklists & Reports**:
    *   **Checklists**: Specific items for Light Vehicles, Heavy Trucks, Heavy Machinery (Excavators, etc.), and Special Equipment.
    *   **Reports**: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Annual strategic reports.
6.  **Action Plans & Governance**: Specific improvement plans (Fuel Reduction, Zero Overdue Docs) and the Management Committee structure.
7.  **Implementation & ROI**: 4-Phase Roadmap and Financial Analysis/ROI projection.
8.  **Compliance & Methodology**: Technical alignment with NR-12 (Machinery Safety) and NR-18 (Construction Safety), plus the Criticality Matrix.

I will remove all conversational fillers (e.g., "Excellent question", "Good luck") to ensure the final output is a clean, corporate-grade presentation ready for your company.
